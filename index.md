Software Engineer based in the city of Glasgow.

Spend my days working on creating the 'google' of the energy supply chain, aggregating information from multiple sources to provide operational insight, and my nights piping and keeping up with what's going on in the tech world.

I can often be found at [Tech Meetup](http://techmeetup.co.uk), [GlasgowJS](http://glasgowjs.com), or one of the many other tech events held in Glasgow or Edinburgh.
