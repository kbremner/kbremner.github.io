  <h1>Welcome! :)</h1>
  <p>Scroll down for more information about me, or use the links above to find out about my <a href="/projects">projects</a> or my <a href="/posts">ramblings</a> about software engineering and Android (with a sprinkling of electronics).</p>

  <p>Originally from Aberdeen, I came to Glasgow in 2008 to study for a Master of Engineering degree in Electronics &amp; Software Engineering at the University of Glasgow. After graduating in May 2013 with a first class honours, I started work at Ecebs, developing mobile application utilising NFC technology as part of innovative smart ticketing solutions.</p>
  <p>One example is <a href="projects/smart_ticket_checker.html" target="_blank">Smart Ticket Checker</a>, an application that allows a user to check the contents of their ITSO-compatible smart card using their NFC-enabled smartphone.</p>

  <p>I have worked on everything from mobile applications utilising NFC, to a high-speed dynamometer logging system, to a Grails-powered API backend and mobile application for a network of energy-harvesting sensor nodes. I enjoy keeping my experience varied.</p>
  <p>I try to keep in touch with the thriving tech community in Glasgow. I regularly attend <a href="http://techmeetup.co.uk/glasgow.html" target="_blank">Tech Meetup Glasgow</a>, and have recently taken part in the <a href="http://glasgow.startupweekend.org" target="_blank">Glasgow Startup Weekend</a>, as well as the Open Glasgow <a href="http://open.glasgow.gov.uk/hackathon/hackathon-no1" target="_blank">Public Safety Hackathon</a>. These events are a great opportunity to network with other developers and discover what else is going on in Glasgow, one that I try to take full advantage of.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I play pipes for Milngavie Pipe Band. Whilst I was studying for my degree, I was also part of the Glasgow &amp; Strathclyde Universities Officer Training Corps Pipes &amp; Drums, reaching the rank of Junior Under Officer (JUO) and acting Pipe Major before leaving on completing my degree.</p>
  <p>Playing in a competing band presents some interesting challenges, requiring every member to concentrate and play as part of a team to produce the best possible performance.</p>
