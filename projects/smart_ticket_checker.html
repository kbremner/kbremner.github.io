<p>In the UK, the Interoperable Transport Standards Organisation (ITSO) is responsible for defining how smart ticketing for transport should be implemented in the UK. By making all schemes adhere to the same specifications, the industry is more competitive as each part of the system can be procured from different supplies. Also, it provides the technical capability for smartcards issued from one scheme to be used in another.</p>
<p>As part of this, the ITSO specifications define how the data on an ITSO-compatible smartcard should be stored. Anyone can read the data from their ITSO-compatible smartcard, and use the freely available specifications to understand the data contained on it.</p>
<p>As part of my final year at the University of Glasgow, I carried out a 6 month industrial project with Ecebs Ltd. The project involved investigating the possible use cases for NFC-enabled Android smartphones interacting with, and emulating, ITSO-compatible smartcards. As part of this over-arching aim, I developed a library for use in Android applications to aide in interacting with presented smartcards. It allowed an application to easily read the contents of the smartcard, as well as add products using Ecebs Remote Ticket Download (RTD) system.</p>
<p>The Smart Ticket Checker application was created to prove what could be done using the created library. Although some information on the smartcard can be scheme-specific, the application provides the user with useful information about the contents of their smartcard. For instance, the application can provide balance and usage information for any Stored Travel Rights (STR) products stored on the card.</p>
<p>The Smart Ticket Checker application is the only application on Google Play that can read any of the currently deployed smartcard types, and it supports most of the product types that are currently in use.</p>
<p>The application can be downloaded from Google Play. Either click the title at the top of the page, or search on Google Play for Smart Ticket Checker.</p>
