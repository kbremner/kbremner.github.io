<p>In the UK, the Interoperable Transport Standards Organisation (ITSO) is responsible for defining the specifications for the various components that are required to implement a transport smart ticketing scheme. These standards define everything from how the smart cards should operate, to how the back-end systems should communicate with each other. As each components must adhere to the relevant ITSO specifications, a new transport smart ticketing scheme can be constructed from components procured from various suppliers, helping to increase competition in the sector. Also, it provides the technical capability for ITSO-compatible smart cards to be used in any ITSO smart ticketing scheme.</p>
<p>As most of the ITSO specifications are <a href="http://www.itso.org.uk/the-specification/specification-resources/publicly-available-specification/" target="_blank">freely available</a>, anyone can read the contents of an ITSO-compatible smart card using either a card reader or a smart phone with NFC. As part of my final year at the University of Glasgow, I carried out a 6 month industrial project with Ecebs Ltd. The project involved investigating the possible use cases for NFC-enabled Android smart phones interacting with, and emulating, ITSO-compatible smart cards. As part of this overarching aim, I developed a library for use in Android applications to aide in interacting with presented smart cards. It allowed an application to easily read the contents of a smart card, as well as add and modify products using Ecebs Remote Ticket Download (RTD) system.</p>
<p>The Smart Ticket Checker application was created to prove what could be done using the created library. Although some information on the smart card can be scheme-specific, the application provides the user with useful information about the contents of their smart card. For instance, it can provide balance and usage information for any Stored Travel Rights (STR) products read from a presented smart card.</p>
<p>The Smart Ticket Checker application is the only application on Google Play that can read all of the currently deployed smart card types, and it supports most of the product types that are currently in use.</p>
