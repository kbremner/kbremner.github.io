<p>With the technologies used by software developers changing so rapidly, it is important to keep up to date with what's going on. I try to expirement with libraries and tools, new and old, where I can. Below are links to details about some of the work and personal projects I have completed.</p>
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item"><a href="Viewtils.html">Viewtils</a></li>
<li class="list-group-item"><a href="smart_ticket_checker.html">Smart Ticket Checker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I like to keep my projects open source and use GitHub to host most of them. Below is a list of the projects I have on GitHub and my recent activity.</p>
<div id="github-timeline-widget"></div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="github-timeline-widget.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
 $(GitHubTimeline({
    username: 'kbremner',
    limit: 20,
    header: 'octocat',
    id: 'github-timeline-widget',
    exclude: ['gist'],
    callback: function () { //code to run once widget is inserted into DOM }
  }));
