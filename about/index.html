  <p>Originally from Aberdeen, I came to Glasgow in 2008 to study for a Master of Engineering degree in Electronics &amp; Software Engineering at the University of Glasgow. After graduating in May 2013 with a first class honours, I started work at Ecebs, developing mobile application utilising NFC technology as part of innovative smart ticketing solutions.</p>

  <p>I have worked on everything from mobile applications utilising NFC, to a high-speed dynamometer logging system, to a Grails-powered API backend and mobile application for a network of energy-harvesting sensor nodes. I enjoy keeping my experience varied.</p>
  <p>I also try to keep in touch with the thriving tech community in Glasgow. I regularly attend <a href="http://techmeetup.co.uk/glasgow.html" target="_blank">Tech Meetup Glasgow</a>, and have recently taken part in the <a href="http://glasgow.startupweekend.org" target="_blank">Glasgow Startup Weekend</a>, as well as the Open Glasgow <a href="http://open.glasgow.gov.uk/hackathon/hackathon-no1" target="_blank">Public Safety Hackathon</a>. These events are a great opportunity to network with other developers and discover what else is going on in Glasgow, one that I try to take full advantage of.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I play pipes for <a href="http://www.milngaviepipeband.org.uk/">Milngavie Pipe Band</a>. The band was recently promoted to grade 3A and hopes to do well in the 2014 competing season.</p>
  <p>Whilst I was studying for my degree, I was also part of the Glasgow &amp; Strathclyde Universities Officer Training Corps Pipes &amp; Drums, reaching the rank of Junior Under Officer (JUO) and acting Pipe Major before leaving on completion of my degree.</p>
