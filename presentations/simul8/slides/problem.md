## Problem
RTDS = no certification, but other challenges&#8230;

* Detecting cards
* RTDS interfaces

<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
<ul>
	<li>Still need to detect cards and parse it's contents. Several hundred pages of ITSO specification related to that</li>
	<li>Need to understand how to interact with RTDS. Doing this incorrectly could corrupt the contents of the card or cause other issues</li>
	<li>Need to make using RTD (and ITSO in general) as simple as possible to encourage terminal developers to create devices for use in ITSO schemes</li>
</ul>
