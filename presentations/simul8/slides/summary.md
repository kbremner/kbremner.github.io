## Review
* C# & Java implementations successful
* Specification = strong base for development


<aside class="notes">
<ul>
	<li>Looking back on the project, we were able to successfully release two implementations of the specification</li>
	<li>From my point of view, the success of the project is really centred around the specification. If any queries arose during development, the specification was used to answer it. If an answer couldn't be found, the spec was updated to address that particular query.</li>
</ul>
