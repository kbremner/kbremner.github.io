* Waterfall (with feedback)
* Define language-independant specification
* Implement spec in Java and C#
* Data-driven testing
* Internal & external release
	* Feedback

<ul>
	<li>Followed a waterfall approach with feedback. For instance, issues identified in the specification during development were translated in to changes. subsequent minor releases have followed a TDD approach</li>
	<li>Spec forms requirements for the project</li>
	<li>Implement in Java and C#. I was responsible for the Java implementation</li>
	<li>Language-independant spec, so we wanted testing to be language-independant.</li>
</ul>
