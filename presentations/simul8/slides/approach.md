<ul>
	<li>Approach mainly followed the waterfall model, but with feedback between the various stages</li>
	<li>Requirements capture took the form of defining a language independant specification</li>
	<li>The spec was then used for creating Java & C# implementations</li>
	<li>Data-driven testing was utilised to allow the same tests to be used for any implementation</li>
	<li>On completion of testing, the SDK was released internally and externally to selected customers</li>
	<li>Feedback from the release resulted in changes to the spec, with further releases being created using a Test Driven Development approach</li>
</ul>
