<ul>
	<li>Working group was formed to define the specification</li>
	<li>Looked at the capabilities of RTDS and the Android framework I developed while on placement, to understand what methods should be defined in the specification</li>
	<li>We also defined the various error scenarios that could occur, and what action the implementation should take if it occurs</li>
